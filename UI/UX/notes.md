# Task Audit — Find Recommended Movies

## Friction

1. Here firstly I just put 001 as title.
   2.I havent inclued typography, I found merging ight make me confuse soo I did them separately
2. Hero headline is generic, its not task-oriented [ChatGPT suggested this]
3. No visual separation between Movies and Books
4. No action after finding movies..

## Fixes

1. Change header title to a better descriptive page name
2. Include the typography section changes like font family and things
3. Promote "Recommended Movies" as a first-class section
4. Add icons or labels for Movies vs Books
5. Add a clear action button (Save / Download / Explore)

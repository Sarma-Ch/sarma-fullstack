# WORKFLOW 
Step 1 : Start Working 

First, I open my project folder in VS Code. I make sure I am on the correct branch  then  I pull the latest changes to stay updated  i.e git pull


Step 2: Make Changes and view status

I create the files I need.
After finishing the changes, I check what has changed i.e used the cmd git status


Step 3 : Usage of git add .

I add the files i want to include in the next commit using git add .


Step 4 : Commit the changes 

I save the work using git commit -m "Msg on what i changed"

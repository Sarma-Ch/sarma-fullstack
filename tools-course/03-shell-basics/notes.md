# Shell Basics – Notes
I am working On VS code and I have particularly used GitBash to run these cmds
## 1. Navigation Commands
- Used 'cd' to move into folders and 'cd ..' to move out.
- Used 'pwd' and verified the path.
- Used cd "name" to move back again 

## 2. Operations
- Created files  'a.txt b.txt c.txt'
- Renamed files using 'mv', copied using 'cp', and deleted files usin 'rm'.

## 3. Writing Into Files
- Wrote a line with 'echo "line" > a.txt' and  it overwrites.
- Added another line with 'echo "line" >> a.txt' to append.

## 4. Inspecting Files
- Created files using cat
- Viewed contents using 'cat', 'less', 'head', 'tail', and learnt about them.

## 5. Searching
- Created z.txt with repeated words.
- Searched using 'grep ERROR z.txt'.

## 6. Pipes
- Tried pipelines like : 'cat first.txt | grep ERROR | wc -l' to run multiple cmds

## 7. History
- Used 'history' to view command list and also I have  used 'Ctrl + R' to search previous cmds .

## Other Areas
Also learnt about Aliases 

I also did,
- Avoid unnecessary usage of 'sudo' because it can damage the system if misused.
